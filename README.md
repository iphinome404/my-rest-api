# Simple REST API (Educational Project)

This is a work-in-progress REST API built in Node.js with Express, created as a learning and demonstration project.

## Features

- Basic CRUD support: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD  
- File-based storage (currently supports only `.json` files)  
- JSON validation and structured error handling  
- Comment-heavy code for learning and documentation purposes  

## Goals

- Practice and demonstrate REST API fundamentals  
- Serve as a base for future improvements  

## Usage

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `npm install`  
3. Start the server with `node index.js` (or your entry point)  
4. The server listens on port `3000` by default  

## Included

- Test script for endpoint verification  
- Dockerfile for containerized deployment  

## Notes

This is a personal educational project developed to deepen understanding of backend development and RESTful API design.
